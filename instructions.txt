The following file contains instructions on how to setup our project.
For additional information, kindly refer to the README at our repository.
https://github.com/jlbyoung/CMPT-414-Binary-Segmentation/

The best platform to run our project is the Google Cloud Platform using their AI 
Platform Notebooks. Kindly setup and instance with the PyTorch Environment, base CPU 
and memory config, and the NVIDIA T4 GPU. Any machine running a unix-based operating 
system, an NVIDIA GPU and cuda toolkit 10.1, and conda installation should work too.

Please follow enter the following commands in your terminal to setup your instance:

- chmod +x init.sh
- ./init.sh (Note: this will take upto 15 minutes)
- conda activate cv414
- cd CMPT-414-Binary-Segmentation

Please run the following command to train the model using the base configuration:

- python train.py -c config.json

Please run the following command to test our current best model.

- python train.py -c config.json --resume model_best.pth

Please run the following command to preview the model on the webcam. 
(Note: this will only work if you are running on your own machine and the webcam is 
configured properly)

- python webcam.py
